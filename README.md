# Spreadsheet Model Generator (SMOG): A Lightweight Tool for Object-Spreadsheet Mapping

[![Maven Test](https://github.com/Onto-Med/SMOG/actions/workflows/maven-test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Onto-Med/SMOG/actions/workflows/maven-test.yml)

## Description

The SMOG generates Java programming models from annotated Excel templates to read and write spreadsheet data.
Following spreadsheet entities are inter alia supported: Fields, Tables and Trees.
The entities must be annotated with entity identifiers "Field:", "Table:", "TreeTable:" followed by the entity
name (see example.xlsx). Additionally, data types of fields or table values can be specified in the corresponding
title or head cells (e.g., [Integer] or [StringL] for list types). For list types, an additional separator character
can be defined (e.g., [StringL] <;>). The default separator character is "|".

String fields of a *table 1* can be declared as foreign keys to fields of another *table 2*.
This results into methods being generated for the Java class of entries in *table 1* to access all referenced entries in
*table 2*.

## How to use

### Executable JAR

Download one of our JAR releases and run it as shown below:

```sh
java -jar smog-x.x.x.jar example.xlsx test/model --package test.model # replace 'x.x.x' with the SMOG version
```

### Maven Dependency

Add SMOG as dependency to your project (e.g. as maven dependency in `pom.xml`). SMOG is available as maven package
on https://maven.pkg.github.com.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.imise.excel_api</groupId>
    <artifactId>smog</artifactId>
    <version><!-- smog version --></version>
</dependency>
```

The following example demonstrates how to start the SMOG:

```java
// Build a ModelGenerator object from Microsoft Excel file: example.xlsx
ModelGenerator gen = new ModelGenerator(new File("example.xlsx")); 

// Use the ModelGenerator object to generate Java class files
// in the directory "test/model" with package name "test.model"
gen.generate(new File("test/model"), "test.model");
```
